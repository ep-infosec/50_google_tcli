# Example device inventory. Likely this will be replaced by calls to a
# database system or other datastore where device data is kept.
# This file serves as a simple example to get users started with TCLI.
#
# Lines starting with '#' are ignored. The first line is the header line and
# each subsequent line is a device and its attributes.
# The first column must be 'device' and if the last column is called 'flags'
# then it and any following entries are added together as a list.


# Header row
device,realm,pop,vendor,flags
# Devices
device_a,lab,abc,cisco,active,alertable
device_b,lab,xyz,cisco,active,alertable
device_c,lab,xyz,juniper,inactive,nonalertable

# Inventory library will parse and convert these contents into the following
# representation:
# {'device_a:
#  Device(realm='lab', pop='abc',vendor='cisco',
#         flags=[active,alertable]),
# 'device_b:
#  Device(realm='lab', pop='xyz',vendor='cisco',
#         flags=[active,alertable]),
# 'device_c:
#  Device(realm='lab', pop='xyz',vendor='juniper',
#         flags=[inactive,nonalertable])
# }
